# Introduction
Smart Agriculture monitoring system is a system that includes IoT and Artificial Intelligence Fuzzy Logic technique that can help farmers to monitor and analyze data about their crops. It also helps farmers to able to generate recommendations to assist farmer on how much water level needed for the plant. In this project, our Intelligent Agriculture Monitoring System will use Fuzzy Rule-based System to develop the intelligent system. Python 3.9 edition is used to optimize the usage of water level based on the real time-based data received from the Arduino Uno which store in cloud MySQL database. It contains temperature sensor, light sensor and soil moisturize sensors. The results should accurately calculate the duration of the water pump for the crops. Moreover, a simple Android mobile apps are created to display all the sensors real-time based data from Arduino Uno.

The proposed of fuzzy logic controller algorithm contains of three input parameters which are temperature sensors (TEMP), soil moisturize sensors (SOIL) and light_intensity sensors (LIGHT). In this proposed algorithm, the range of the temperature is taken to be 0 to 60 degree Celcius (â„ƒ), 0 to 1023 (PAW) for soil moisture and 0 to 20K (LUX) for light intensity. For the water pump output duration, the range is between 0 to 90 minutes. This algorithm will be implemented by setting up all the individual inputs and output in this system. 

# Monitor Dashboard
Grafana is an open source which provide multi-platform for analysis and interacting visualization web application such as dashboard, graph, gauge, etc. To open/visit our monitor dashboard, you have to install localhost grafana server through Link and then click the Grafana URL. The url will direct you to our monitor dashboard.

Link to download Grafana server = https://grafana.com/get/

S.A.M.S Monitor Dashboard URL = http://localhost:3000/goto/og7Le8aGz

# Simple Mobile App
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. In this project, we only develop a simple Android mobile app to display the real-time based data of the sensors. To install our mobile app, download the APK file in your smartphone through the link below provided. 

Dowmload APK file = [app.zip](https://github.com/caini1213/Smart-Agriculture-Monitoring-System/files/5792320/app.zip)
